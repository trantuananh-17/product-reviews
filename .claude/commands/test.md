description: Run tests and validate code quality

Use the `tester` agent to:
1. Run the test suite (`npm test`)
2. Check for lint errors (`npm run lint`)
3. Validate build (`npm run build`)
4. Report results with recommendations

## Quick Commands
```bash
npm test              # All tests
npm run test:coverage # With coverage
npm run lint          # Lint check
npm run build         # Build validation
```
